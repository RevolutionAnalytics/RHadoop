# Compatibility testing for rmr 2.0.x
Please contribute with additional reports. To claim compatibility you need to run `R CMD  check path-to-rmr` successfully.
As with any new release, testing on additional platforms is under way. If you build your own Hadoop, see [Which Hadoop for rmr](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki/Which-Hadoop-for-rmr).
