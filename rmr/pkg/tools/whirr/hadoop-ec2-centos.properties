# Hadoop Cluster on AWS EC2
# 
# With changes to make installing RHadoop/rmr easier

# Read the Configuration Guide for more info:
# http://incubator.apache.org/whirr/configuration-guide.html

# Change the cluster name here
whirr.cluster-name=hadoop-ec2

# Change the number of machines in the cluster here
whirr.instance-templates=1 hadoop-namenode+hadoop-jobtracker,5 hadoop-datanode+hadoop-tasktracker

# Uncomment out these lines to run CDH
# You need cdh3 because of the streaming combiner backport
whirr.hadoop.install-function=install_cdh_hadoop
whirr.hadoop.configure-function=configure_cdh_hadoop
# just-released Whirr 0.7.1 fixes java:
whirr.java.install-function=install_oab_java 

# For EC2 set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
whirr.provider=aws-ec2
whirr.identity=${env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
whirr.credential=${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}

# The size of the instance to use. See http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
whirr.hardware-id=m1.large
# whirr.hardware-id=c1.xlarge

# select recent, 64-bit CentOS 4.6 AMI from RightScale
whirr.image-id=us-east-1/ami-49e32320

# If you choose a different location, make sure whirr.image-id is updated too
whirr.location-id=us-east-1

# You can also specify the spot instance price
# http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/
# whirr.aws-ec2-spot-price=0.15

# By default use the user system SSH keys. Override them here.
# whirr.private-key-file=${sys:user.home}/.ssh/id_rsa
# whirr.public-key-file=${whirr.private-key-file}.pub

# Expert: override Hadoop properties by setting properties with the prefix
# hadoop-common, hadoop-hdfs, hadoop-mapreduce to set Common, HDFS, MapReduce
# site properties, respectively. The prefix is removed by Whirr, so that for
# example, setting 
# hadoop-common.fs.trash.interval=1440
# will result in fs.trash.interval being set to 1440 in core-site.xml.

# Expert: specify the version of Hadoop to install.
#whirr.hadoop.version=0.20.2
