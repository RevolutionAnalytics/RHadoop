# Newly-released Whirr 0.7.1 fixes problems with the Java installation which 
# were caused by changes in licensing of Java by Oracle

# To set up a hadoop/rmr cluster first launch the cluster

$WHIRR_HOME/bin/whirr launch-cluster --config hadoop-ec2.properties
#this config slightly tweaked from whirr distro, starts 5 large nodes

# then install R and rmr
$WHIRR_HOME/bin/whirr run-script --script rmr.sh --config hadoop-ec2.properties

# remember to destroy when done. You are responsible for any AWS charges

$WHIRR_HOME/bin/whirr destroy-cluster --config hadoop-ec2.properties

# 'hadoop-ec2-centos.properties' and 'rmr-master-centos.sh' can be used with 
# the above steps to create a CentOS 4.6-based cluster using a RightScale AMI
